" A computer virus is a software program that has been intentionally created to cause a user grief, spread to other computers, or destroy data on an individual's computer. To help prevent a computer from becoming infected by a virus, software developers have developed anti virus programs that stay active on the computer helping to protect it. It is important to realize that many computers do not come pre-loaded with these already installed and that if computers do come with these programs, the programs may expire within 90 days.",IT
 All versions of Microsoft Windows do not come pre-installed with a virus protection program. This includes: Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows 10.,IT

"My Computer does not power up?- Check that all the cables are securely plugged into the back of the machine and the monitor. Check that the power cables are plugged into a power socket and the socket has been turned on. Try using a different power socket or, if you are using a power extension strip, plug the power cable directly into a power socket in the wall. Replace the power cable with one that you know works. Check if there are any lights on at the front of the machine: If there are lights on the machine but not the monitor, then it's probably a monitor issue. If there are lights on the monitor but not the machine, then it's probably a machine issue. If there are no lights on anything, then it may be possible there is a local power cut. With laptops, try removing the power cable and the battery. Hold down the power button for about ten seconds, and then plug the battery and power cable in again. Press the power button to see if it switches on. ",IT

If you are using a plug strip, make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket and that the power switch on the plug strip is turned on.

"I can't receive any email attachments?- If the e-mail box is full of other e-mail messages, and/or your storage space is only a few megabytes, it's possible that the attachment being sent cannot be received. Often if this problem is occurring the person sending the e-mail should get a response back from your e-mail server indicating that your mailbox is full and/or has exceeded its allocated size. Because computer viruses and other malware are best distributed through e-mail, many e-mail service providers, companies, and e-mail programs prevent certain types of file extensions from being distributed or received through e-mail. For example, Microsoft Outlook protect its users by automatically disabling certain file extension types from being received in e-mail.",IT
"There are black borders on my screen, what do I do?- If the resolution was recently changed it is possible for the monitor to not auto adjust or shift to the correct size.

Is it safe to turn off a Windows computer without doing a shut down?- Users should not simply press the power button or restart the computer while Windows is still running unless there is an issue with the computer.

In fact many versions of Microsoft Windows will check the computer for any problems if the computer is not shut down properly.,IT
Why is my mouse acting erratically?- Users who have an optical mechanical mouse (most common mouse for desktop computers) are likely experiencing erratic behaviour because the mouse is not clean or is dirty. If you've cleaned the mouse and continue to encounter issues and this mouse has worked in the past fine unfortunately your mouse is likely defective. One additional test that can be done to help determine if this is the case or not is to connect the mouse to another computer. Otherwise we suggest replacing the mouse.,IT
"I get a 'no signal input' message, what do I do?- Verify that the monitor is properly connected in the back of the monitor as well as to the back of the computer. If the monitor appears to be connected properly, verify that a cable is not loose by disconnecting all cables that can be disconnected in the back of the monitor (generally the data cable cannot be disconnected).

Most Computers will also have screw ends that can be screwed in to hold the connector in place.",IT
