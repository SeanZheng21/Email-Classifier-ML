# Email Classifier ML
 Machine Learning models for classifying Email categories.

This notebook creates a machine learning model that classifies emails into three categories: HR, Marketing, IT.

We have a .csv dataset that contains examples of emails for each category. The machine learning model does the prediction of the category of a given email (assume that the input will always be a text).

After that, the ML model is tested out with some examples (1 example per category) that are not in the dataset.
